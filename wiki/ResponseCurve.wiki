This is an implementation of the Response Curves discussed by Bob Alexander in his The Beauty of Response Curves (Game AI Programming Wisdom 1).

Essentially, this class provides an efficient implementation of arbitrary functions (approximated by line segments).
The following is a linear approximation for cos (in the range 0 to π):

{{{
float outputSamples[11] = {1.0, 0.95f, 0.81f, 0.59f, 0.31f, 0.0f, -0.31f, -0.59f, -0.81f, -0.95f, -1.0f};
ResponseCurve<10, float> cos2(0.0f, 3.14f, outputSamples);

for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
{
	float x = 3.14f * i / 100.0f;
	cout << abs(cos(x) – cos2(x));
}
}}}

Essentially, this class provides a implementation for a lookup table with linear interpolation.
