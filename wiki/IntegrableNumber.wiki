#summary An IntegrableNumber is a number that keeps track of its own integrals (sums) over a fixed number of updates.

An IntegrableNumber is a number that keeps track of its own integrals over a fixed number of updates.

This is for example useful for keeping a running average of a sequence of values.

For example, 

{{{

Integrable<float, 1, 3> v(0);

...

void update(float currentValue)
{
   v.setValue(currentValue);

   average = 0.3333f * v.getValue(1);
}

}}}

Here {{{v}}} keeps track of the last three values of v, sothat the average value of v over three updates is given by {{{1.0 / 3 * v.getValue()}}}. We can also keep an average of the average:

{{{

Integrable<float, 2, 3> v(0);

...

void update(float currentValue)
{
   v.setValue(currentValue);

   average = 0.1111f * v.getValue(2);
}

}}}
